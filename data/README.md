Data readme for floodGAM


how to get the data (lescon_var). where do we get the files for catchment covariates? the shape files and stuff? gotta ask kolbjørn.

where we get the station and version numbers: that one report and manual control

I guess there's three things here: where we get/how we process the vannføring data, how weget the flomkart felt covariates, how we get the zfelt covariates. 



 - what the file structure means
     - raw data
     - Rdata
     - how-to manuals
 - what data we use: vannføring + covariates for flomkartfelt, covariates for zfelt
 - where we get the station and version numbers
 - what database we used and why
