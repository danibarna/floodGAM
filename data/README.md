## Overview

Flood dataset focused on sub-daily sampling frequency for flood
frequency analysis using annual maximum data. It includes 259 stations,
each with at least 20 years of total data and at least 11 years of
sub-daily data.

The stations are based on NVE-rapport 2016:85 [Flomdata: utvalg og
kvalitetssikring av flomdata for
flomfrekvensanalyser](https://asp.bibliotekservice.no/nve/title.aspx?tkey=23147),
but include added requirements for sub-daily sampling frequency around
annual maxima and data up to 2023.
