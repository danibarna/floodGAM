## File structure

 - `raw-data` – HYDRA II database commands, original tables from reports, and other raw data.

 - `processed-data` – Any data loaded/manipulated/changed/saved with code from the `code` folders and ready for analysis. Any files located in here are based on the raw data and can be re-created with the scripts in the [1-data-creation](/code/scripts/1-data-creation) folder.

 - `how-to-guides` – how to use the database commands in `raw-data`.
 

The `cleaned-data` folder can be used to save intermediate datafiles when processing the (very large) streamflow record files. It is mostly empty in the online version of the repository (files too large for upload).
