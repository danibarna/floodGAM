## Overview

Flood dataset focused on sub-daily sampling frequency for flood frequency analysis using annual maximum data. It includes 259 stations, each with at least 20 years of total data and at least 11 years of sub-daily data.

The stations are based on NVE-rapport 2016:85 [Flomdata: utvalg og kvalitetssikring av flomdata for flomfrekvensanalyser](https://asp.bibliotekservice.no/nve/title.aspx?tkey=23147), with added requirements for sub-daily sampling frequency around annual maxima and data up to 2023. 


## How to get the data

download the set of annual maxima [l/s/km2] here. 

download catchment covariates for each of the 259 stations here.

the full streamflow time series for each station is too large to upload here, but can be found on the NVE server at (link). The database commands used to pull the data from HYDRA II are saved in this repository at (link) and a database how-to guide can be found at (link).

We also store other datasets relevant to the floodGAM analysis in this repository. The raw-data folder contains the list of station names, version numbers, and manually controlled utelatt years and stations used to make the database commands. The how-to folder contains guides describing how to get raw streamflow data. The Rdata folder saves many intermediate data objects used in the analysis. 

All code used to clean and construct the dataset can be found here.
